## Regressions

* Determining MIME type from file extension (using `:mime_types` or
  `:mini_mime` analyzers) when file is empty now works again. This was the
  behaviour prior to version 2.7.0, but 2.7.0 introduced a regression where
  `nil` was returned for empty files, even if they had an extension.
