Regressions
===========

* The previous version introduced explicit default permissions for created
  files and directories in FileSystem storage. However, the current behaviour
  was applying directory permissions to the directory the storage is
  initialized with. This would raise a `Errno::EPERM` exception for directories
  for which the permissions cannot be changed, for example `Dir.tmpdir`. This
  is now changed; when FileSystem storage is now initialized with a directory,
  the permissions won't be changed if this directory already exists.
