Regressions
===========

* Shrine 1.4.0 introduced a regression where it didn't trigger callbacks for
  promoting files anymore. This was done in order to eliminate a tiny chance
  for a race condition when same attachment is updated subsequently with
  backgrounding. We bring back triggering callbacks on promote. For Sequel we
  eliminate the chance of a race condition, while ActiveRecord users can now
  add optimistic locking to prevent this.
