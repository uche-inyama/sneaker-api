title: AWS S3
---

The S3 storage handles uploads to [AWS S3] service (or any s3-compatible
service such as [DigitalOcean Spaces] or [MinIO]). It requires the [aws-sdk-s3]
gem:

```rb
# Gemfile
gem "aws-sdk-s3", "~> 1.14"
```

## Initialization

The storage is initialized by providing your bucket name, region and
credentials:

```rb
require "shrine/storage/s3"

s3 = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(
  bucket: "my-app", # required
  region: "eu-west-1", # required
  access_key_id: "abc",
  secret_access_key: "xyz",
)
```

> The storage requires the following AWS S3 permissions:
>
>  * `s3:ListBucket` for the bucket resource
>  * `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:PutObjectAcl`, `s3:DeleteObject`,
>    `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts` and `s3:AbortMultipartUpload` for the object
>    resources

> The `:access_key_id` and `:secret_access_key` options is just one form of
> authentication, see the [AWS SDK docs][credentials] for more options.

The storage exposes the underlying Aws objects:

```rb
s3.client #=> #<Aws::S3::Client>
s3.client.access_key_id #=> "abc"
s3.client.secret_access_key #=> "xyz"
s3.client.region #=> "eu-west-1"

s3.bucket #=> #<Aws::S3::Bucket>
s3.bucket.name #=> "my-app"

s3.object("key") #=> #<Aws::S3::Object>
```

## Public uploads

By default, uploaded S3 objects will have private visibility, meaning they can
only be accessed via signed expiring URLs generated using your private S3
credentials.

```rb
s3 = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(**s3_options)
s3.upload(io, "key") # uploads with default "private" ACL
s3.url("key")        # https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/key?X-Amz-Expires=900&X-Amz-Signature=b22d37c37d...
```

If you would like to generate public URLs, you can tell S3 storage to make
uploads public:

```rb
s3 = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(public: true, **s3_options)
s3.upload(io, "key") # uploads with "public-read" ACL
s3.url("key")        # https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/key
```

If you want to make only *some* uploads public, you can conditionally apply the
`:acl` upload option and `:public` URL option:

```rb
Shrine.plugin :upload_options, store: -> (io, **) { { acl: "public-read" } }
Shrine.plugin :url_options,    store: -> (io, **) { { public: true } }
```

## Prefix

The `:prefix` option can be specified for uploading all files inside a specific
S3 prefix (folder), which is useful when using S3 for both cache and store:

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "cache", **s3_options)
```

## Upload options

Sometimes you'll want to add additional upload options to all S3 uploads. You
can do that by passing the `:upload_options` option:

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(upload_options: { acl: "private" }, **s3_options)
```

These options will be passed to aws-sdk-s3's methods for [uploading], [copying]
and [presigning].

You can also generate upload options per upload with the `upload_options`
plugin

```rb
Shrine.plugin :upload_options, store: -> (io, derivative: nil, **) do
  if derivative == :thumb
    { acl: "public-read" }
  else
    { acl: "private" }
  end
end
```

or when using the uploader directly

```rb
uploader.upload(file, upload_options: { acl: "private" })
```

> Unlike the `:upload_options` storage option, upload options given on
  the uploader level won't be forwarded for generating presigns, since presigns
  are generated using the storage directly.

## URL Host

If you want your S3 object URLs to be generated with a different URL host (e.g.
a CDN), you can specify the `:host` option to `#url`:

```rb
s3.url("image.jpg", host: "http://abc123.cloudfront.net")
#=> "http://abc123.cloudfront.net/image.jpg"
```

The host URL can include a path prefix, but it needs to end with a slash:

```rb
s3.url("image.jpg", host: "https://your-s3-host.com/prefix/") # needs to end with a slash
#=> "http://your-s3-host.com/prefix/image.jpg"
```

To have the `:host` option passed automatically for every URL, use the
`url_options` plugin:

```rb
plugin :url_options, store: { host: "http://abc123.cloudfront.net" }
```

### Signer

If you would like to [serve private content via CloudFront], you need to sign
the object URLs with a special signer, such as [`Aws::CloudFront::UrlSigner`]
provided by the `aws-sdk-cloudfront` gem. The S3 storage initializer accepts a
`:signer` block, which you can use to call your signer:

```rb
require "aws-sdk-cloudfront"

signer = Aws::CloudFront::UrlSigner.new(
  key_pair_id:      "cf-keypair-id",
  private_key_path: "./cf_private_key.pem"
)

Shrine::Storage::S3.new(signer: signer.method(:signed_url))
# or
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(signer: -> (url, **options) { signer.signed_url(url, **options) })
```

## URL options

Other than `:host` and `:public` URL options, all additional `S3#url` options
are forwarded to [`Aws::S3::Object#presigned_url`].

```rb
s3.url(
  expires_in: 15,
  response_content_disposition: ContentDisposition.attachment("my-filename"),
  response_content_type: "foo/bar",
  # ...
)
```

## Presigns

The `S3#presign` method can be used for generating parameters for direct upload
to S3:

```rb
s3.presign("key") #=>
# {
#   url: "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/...",
#   fields: { ... },  # blank for PUT presigns
#   headers: { ... }, # blank for POST presigns
#   method: "post",
# }
```

By default, parameters for a POST upload is generated, but you can also
generate PUT upload parameters:

```rb
s3.presign("key", method: :put)
```

Any additional options are forwarded to [`Aws::S3::Object#presigned_post`]
(for POST uploads) and [`Aws::S3::Object#presigned_url`] (for PUT uploads).

```rb
s3.presign("key", method: :put, content_disposition: "attachment; filename=my-file.txt") #=>
# {
#   url: "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/...",
#   fields: {},
#   headers: { "Content-Disposition" => "attachment; filename=my-file.txt" },
#   method :put,
# }
```

## Large files

The aws-sdk-s3 gem has the ability to automatically use multipart upload/copy
for larger files, splitting the file into multiple chunks and uploading/copying
them in parallel.

By default, multipart upload will be used for files larger than 15MB, and
multipart copy for files larger than 100MB, but you can change the thresholds
via `:multipart_threshold`:

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(
  multipart_threshold: { upload: 30*1024*1024, copy: 200*1024*1024 },
  **s3_options,
)
```

## Encryption

The easiest way to use **server-side** encryption for uploaded S3 objects is to
configure default encryption for your S3 bucket. Alternatively, you can pass
server-side encryption parameters to the API calls.

The `S3#upload` method accepts `:sse_*` options:

```rb
s3.upload(io, "key", sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
                     sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
                     sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5",
                     ssekms_key_id:          "key_id")
```

The `S3#presign` method accepts `:server_side_encryption_*` options for POST
presigns, and the same `:sse_*` options as above for PUT presigns.

```rb
s3.presign("key", server_side_encryption_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
                  server_side_encryption_customer_key:       "secret_key",
                  server_side_encryption_aws_kms_key_id:     "key_id")
```

When downloading encrypted S3 objects, the same server-side encryption
parameters need to be passed in.

```rb
s3.open("key", sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
               sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
               sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5")
```

**Client-side** encryption is supported as well:

```rb
encryption_client = Aws::S3::EncryptionV2::Client.new(...)
s3 = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(client: encryption_client, **other_options)

s3.upload(io, "key") # encrypts on upload
s3.open("key")       # decrypts on download
```

## Accelerate endpoint

To use Amazon S3's [Transfer Acceleration] feature, set
`:use_accelerate_endpoint` to `true` when initializing the storage:

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(use_accelerate_endpoint: true, **other_options)
```

## Deleting prefixed

If you want to delete all objects in some prefix, you can use
`S3#delete_prefixed`:

```rb
s3.delete_prefixed("some_prefix/") # deletes all objects in "some_prefix/"
```

## Clearing cache

If you're using S3 as a cache, you will probably want to periodically delete
old files which aren't used anymore. S3 has a built-in way to do this, read
[this article][object lifecycle] for instructions.

Alternatively you can periodically call the `#clear!` method:

```rb
# deletes all objects that were uploaded more than 7 days ago
s3.clear! { |object| object.last_modified < Time.now - 7*24*60*60 }
