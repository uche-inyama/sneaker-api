title: Determine MIME Type
---

The [`determine_mime_type`][determine_mime_type] plugin allows you to determine
and store the actual MIME type of the file analyzed from file content.

```rb
plugin :determine_mime_type
```

By default the UNIX [file] utility is used to determine the MIME type, and the
result is automatically written to the `mime_type` metadata field. You can
choose a different built-in MIME type analyzer, for example:

```rb
plugin :determine_mime_type, analyzer: :marcel
```

## Analyzers

The following analyzers are accepted:

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------         | :-----------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `:file`         | (**Default**). Uses the [file] utility to determine the MIME type from file contents. It is installed by default on most operating systems, but the [Windows equivalent] needs to be installed separately.                                                                            |
| `:fastimage`    | Uses the [fastimage] gem to determine the MIME type from file contents. Fastimage is optimized for speed over accuracy. Best used for image content.                                                                                                                              |
| `:filemagic`    | Uses the [ruby-filemagic] gem to determine the MIME type from file contents, using a similar MIME database as the `file` utility. Unlike the `file` utility, ruby-filemagic works on Windows without any setup.                                                                   |
| `:mimemagic`    | Uses the [mimemagic] gem to determine the MIME type from file contents. Unlike ruby-filemagic, mimemagic is a pure-ruby solution, so it will work across all Ruby implementations.                                                                                                |
| `:marcel`       | Uses the [marcel] gem to determine the MIME type from file contents. Marcel is Basecamp's wrapper around mimemagic, it adds priority logic (preferring magic over name when given both), some extra type definitions, and common type subclasses (including Keynote, Pages, etc). |
| `:mime_types`   | Uses the [mime-types] gem to determine the MIME type from the file extension. Note that unlike other solutions, this analyzer is not guaranteed to return the actual MIME type of the file.                                                                                       |
| `:mini_mime`    | Uses the [mini_mime] gem to determine the MIME type from the file extension. Note that unlike other solutions, this analyzer is not guaranteed to return the actual MIME type of the file.                                                                                        |
| `:content_type` | Retrieves the value of the `#content_type` attribute of the IO object. Note that this value normally comes from the "Content-Type" request header, so it's not guaranteed to hold the actual MIME type of the file.                                                               |

You'll need to ensure the file utility or gem is in installed on your system
for Shrine to use the analyzer.

## Analyzer Options

Currently, Marcel is the only analyzer that accepts options to be passed in.
Analyzer options can be set in one of two ways:

```rb
plugin :determine_mime_type, analyzer: :marcel, analyzer_options: { filename_fallback: true }

# or

plugin :determine_mime_type, analyzer: -> (io, analyzers) do
  mime_type = analyzers[:marcel].call(io, filename_fallback: true)
end
```

The `:filename_fallback` option for Marcel analyzer lets it use the filename as
a fallback option when it fails to determine the MIME type from the file
content. Set `:filename_fallback` to `true` in order to fallback to using the
filename or set to `false` to not use the filename (this is the default).

## Issues

If you find using a single analyzer is not able to recognize all of the file
types in your application, you can build your own custom analyzer and combine
the built-in analyzers. For example, if you want to correctly determine MIME
type of .css, .js, .json, .csv, .xml, or similar text-based files, you can
combine `file` and `mime_types` analyzers:

```rb
plugin :determine_mime_type, analyzer: -> (io, analyzers) do
  mime_type = analyzers[:file].call(io)
  mime_type = analyzers[:mime_types].call(io) if mime_type == "text/plain"
  mime_type
end
```

## API

You can also use the methods for determining the MIME type directly:

```rb
# or YourUploader.determine_mime_type(io)
Shrine.determine_mime_type(io) #=> "image/jpeg" (calls the defined analyzer)
# or just
Shrine.mime_type(io) #=> "image/jpeg" (calls the defined analyzer)

# or YourUploader.mime_type_analyzers
Shrine.mime_type_analyzers[:file].call(io) #=> "image/jpeg" (calls a built-in analyzer)
```

## Instrumentation

If the `instrumentation` plugin has been loaded, the `determine_mime_type` plugin
adds instrumentation around MIME type analyzation.

```rb
# instrumentation plugin needs to be loaded *before* determine_mime_type
plugin :instrumentation
plugin :determine_mime_type
```

Analyzing MIME type will trigger a `mime_type.shrine` event with the following
payload:

| Key         | Description                            |
| :--         | :----                                  |
| `:io`       | The IO object                          |
| `:uploader` | The uploader class that sent the event |

A default log subscriber is added as well which logs these events:

```
MIME Type (33ms) â€“ {:io=>StringIO, :uploader=>Shrine}
```

You can also use your own log subscriber:

```rb
plugin :determine_mime_type, log_subscriber: -> (event) {
  Shrine.logger.info JSON.generate(name: event.name, duration: event.duration, **event.payload)
}
```
```
{"name":"mime_type","duration":24,"io":"#<StringIO:0x00007fb7c5b08b80>","uploader":"Shrine"}
```

Or disable logging altogether:

```rb
plugin :determine_mime_type, log_subscriber: nil
```
